                    <h1>History of Tallinn</h1>
                </div>


                <p>Tallinn has a long history dating back to 3000 BCE when archaeological traces of a small
                    hunter-fisherman
                    community
                    were found.
                    Around 1050 AD, a fortress was built in what is now central Tallinn, on the hill of Toompea.
                    Tallinn received Lübeck city rights in 1248.
                </p>

                <h2>The Danish rule</h2>
                <p>As an important port on a major trade route between Novgorod and western Europe, it became a target
                    for the
                    expansion
                    of the Teutonic Knights and the Kingdom of Denmark during the period of Northern Crusades in the
                    beginning
                    of the
                    13th century when Christianity was forcibly imposed on the local population. Danish rule of Tallinn
                    and
                    northern
                    Estonia started in 1219.<br>
                    In 1285, Tallinn, then known more widely as Reval, became the northernmost member of the Hanseatic
                    League –
                    a
                    mercantile and military alliance of German-dominated cities in Northern Europe. The king of Denmark
                    sold
                    Reval along
                    with other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346.
                    Reval was arguably the most significant medieval port in the Gulf of Finland. Reval enjoyed a
                    strategic
                    position at
                    the crossroads of trade between the rest of western Europe and Novgorod and Muscovy in the east. The
                    city,
                    with a
                    population of about 8,000, was very well fortified with city walls and 66 defence towers.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>The Swedish Rule</h2>
                <p>Russia, Sweden, Poland and Denmark battled for superiority in the Northern part of the Baltic Sea in
                    the
                    Livonian War
                    of 1558-1583. Territory of Estonia was one of the main battle grounds. Scared of the Russian troops
                    Tallinn
                    town and
                    Harju-Viru knighthood retreated to the Swedish Crown in 1561.
                    It was during the Swedish era that Tallinn became the centre of a new administrative unit—the
                    Estonian
                    government.
                    During the Swedish rule the importance of Tallinn was decreasing compared to the middle ages.
                    The big plague epidemic ravaged the town in 1602-1603, the Great Fire of 1684 destroyed most of the
                    buildings at
                    Toompea. Only Dome Church and a small stone house nearby were more or less unharmed.
                    The development of education generally characteristic to the Swedish era influenced Tallinn as well:
                    a
                    gymnasium was
                    established at the Cisterian nunnery that had finally been dismissed some years earlier—today it is
                    known as
                    Gustav
                    Adolf Gymnasium.
                </p>

                <h2>The Russian Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    The Northern War devastated the Baltic Sea area from 1700 to 1721. The main adversaries were Sweden
                    and
                    Russia who
                    battled for superiority in the territory.
                    In 1710 Tallinn capitulated without fight to the Russian troops. If there were 10 000 residents in
                    Tallinn
                    in 1708
                    then after the events of 1710 only about 2000 had survived. The local self-government institutions
                    (Magistracy of
                    Reval and Estonian Knighthood) retained their cultural and economical autonomy within Imperial
                    Russia as the
                    Governorate of Estonia. The Magistracy of Reval was abolished in 1889. The 19th century brought
                    industrialisation of
                    the city and the port kept its importance.
                </p>

                <h2>Republic of Estonia</h2>
                <p>
                    On February 24, 1918 Estonia took advantage of the weakening Bolsheviks and proclaimed independence;
                    already
                    the
                    next day German troops occupied Estonia.
                    Local town government was restored after Germany capitulated in the WW I. The first city council
                    elected
                    during the
                    Republic of Estonia assembled on June 16, 1919.
                    Tallinn population began to grow hand in hand with the development of industry in the 2nd half of
                    the 19th
                    century.
                    If in 1881 Tallinn had almost 44 000 inhabitants, then in 1917 the population was almost 160 000.

                <h2>Tallinn from Soviet Occupation till Estonia Regains Independence</h2>
                <p>
                    During World War II, Estonia was first occupied by the Soviet army and annexed into the USSR in the
                    summer
                    of 1940,
                    then occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. During the German occupation Tallinn suffered from
                    many
                    instances
                    of aerial bombing by the Soviet air force. During the most destructive Soviet bombing raid on 9–10
                    March
                    1944, over
                    a thousand incendiary bombs were dropped on the town, causing widespread fires, killing 757 people,
                    and
                    leaving over
                    20,000 residents of Tallinn without shelter. After the German retreat in September 1944, the city
                    was
                    occupied again
                    by the Soviet Union.
                    The population of Tallinn decreased in the first half of 1940-s mainly due to the events of the WW
                    II (war
                    losses,
                    emigration to West). By 1939 the city population had decreased from 145 000 to 127 000.
                    Industry boomed significantly in Tallinn during the Soviet times—machinery construction and
                    electro-technical
                    companies were established and most of their production went to the Soviet military industry.

                <h2>Tallinn from Regaining Independence till today</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1991, the independent democratic Estonian nation was re-established and a period of quick
                    development as
                    a modern
                    European capital ensued. Tallinn became the capital of a de facto independent country once again on
                    20
                    August 1991.
                    The Old Town became a World Heritage Site in 1997, and the city hosted the 2002 Eurovision Song
                    Contest.
                    Tallinn was the 2011 European Capital of Culture, and will be the 2023 European Green Capital Award.
                    The
                    city
                    has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and takes pride in its biodiversity and
                    high air
                    quality.

                        spire of the Tallinn Town Hall in 1530. Old Thomas later became a popular symbol of the
                        city.
